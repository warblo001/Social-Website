# Social Media App 

This project is part of the Microverse Ruby on Rails training curriculum. In this project I created a self-linking association for the User's table, in order to keep track of which users were friends with each other.

## Built With

- Ruby v3.0.1
- Ruby on Rails v5.2.4

## Live Demo

https://limitless-reaches-44142.herokuapp.com/users/sign_in


## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

Ruby: 3.0.1
Rails: 5.2.3
Postgres: >=9.5

### Setup

Instal gems with:

```
bundle install
```

Setup database with:

```
   rails db:create
   rails db:migrate
```

### Github Actions

To make sure the linters' checks using Github Actions work properly, you should follow the next steps:

1. On your recently forked repo, enable the GitHub Actions in the Actions tab.
2. Create the `feature/branch` and push.
3. Start working on your milestone as usual.
4. Open a PR from the `feature/branch` when your work is done.


### Usage

Start server with:

```
    rails server
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

### Run tests

```
    rpsec --format documentation
```

> Tests will be added by Microverse students. There are no tests for initial features in order to make sure that students write all tests from scratch.
